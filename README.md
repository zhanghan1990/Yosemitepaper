Nowadays, applications (map-reduce, distributed storage, etc) in data center need the data center network to provide them with low latency and high throughput. However, network resources in data center network are limited, so efficient network resources schedule methods are needed. Recently, the proposed application level abstraction coflow tries to regard flow set as a whole, so the transfer latency of application will be re- duced. This abstraction is better than flow level schedule method because it considers the semantics of the application partly. However, more application semantics should be considered such as the importance of application. This is because different ap- plications in data center may have different level of importance, scheduling only depends on network condition and coflow set are not enough. In this paper, we advocate that when scheduling coflow, we should also take the importance of application into consideration. We incorporate weight to present the importance of application and try to minimize weight completion time of coflow. According to this, we propose Yosemite-a framework that aims to minimize coflow weight completion time. Simulation shows that Yosemite performs about 20%-50% better than Varys to minimize coflow completion time. We also deploy Yosemite system on our open-stack testbed, evaluation shows that for the file backup applications, Yosemite performs about XX better than Varys.
